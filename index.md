## About Me

I am a PhD student in computational materials science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research focuses on developing and applying advanced computational methods for studying two-dimensional materials, particularly graphene-based systems.

My work combines tight-binding models with machine learning approaches to enable accurate and efficient simulations of complex material systems at scales previously inaccessible to traditional *ab initio* methods.

## Research Interests

- **Tight-Binding Methods**: Development of Total Energy Tight Binding (TETB) models for accurate prediction of electronic structure and total energies
- **Two-Dimensional Materials**: Computational study of graphene, bilayer graphene, and twisted bilayer graphene systems
- **Machine Learning for Materials**: Integration of machine learning techniques with physics-based models
- **Multi-scale Modeling**: Bridging quantum mechanical accuracy with classical simulation efficiency
- **Electronic Structure Theory**: Band structure calculations and electronic properties of layered materials

## Software Packages

- **TETB_GRAPHENE**: Developed a Python package for efficient calculation of forces, energies, and band structures in multi-layer graphene systems
- **BLG_model_builder**: Created tools for uncertainty quantification of models for bilayer graphene models
- **AtomBridge**: LLM-agent used to construct .cif files from published STEM papers

## News

*Coming soon: Updates on recent publications and presentations*
